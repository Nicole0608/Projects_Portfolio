# Projects Portfolio
This repository contains examples of my solutions for various analytical and data science cases
| Project | Summary | Tools |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Research analysis of apartment advertisements](https://github.com/Nicole0608/Projects_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Apartments_Project.ipynb)| As data, there is an archive of advertisements for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. The **goal** of this project is to study the main parameters of apartments affecting their price. | **pandas, matplotlib** <br /> Data preprocessing, explaratory data analysis, histograms, boxplot, scatter plots, correlation analysis |
| [Research analysis of telecom users](https://github.com/Nicole0608/Projects_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Tariffs_Project.ipynb)  | Telecom operator - Company X - offers its customers two tariff plans: 'Smart' and 'Ultra'. To adjust the ad budget, the company wants to understand which plan makes the most money. The **goal** of the project: to analyze customers' behavior and conclude which tariff is better.  | **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, math, scipy** <br />  Data preprocessing, adding new variables, histograms, <br /> t-test |
| [Sales analysis for game store](https://github.com/Nicole0608/Projects_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Sales_Analysis.ipynb)  | The **goal** is to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game sales for the international game store. This will allow to bet on a potentially popular product and plan the company's advertising campaigns for the next year.  | **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy** <br /> Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, line plots, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation analysis, heatmap, barplots, t-test |
| [Tariff recommendation project (ML)](https://github.com/Nicole0608/Projects_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Tariff_Recommendation_Project.ipynb)  | The **goal**: to build a model capable of analyzing the behavior of customers of the mobile operator "Megaline" and offer users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra".  | **pandas, numpy, sklearn** <br /> Data preprocessing, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression |
| [Customers churn analysis (ML)](https://github.com/Nicole0608/Projects_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Customers_Churn.ipynb)  | The **goal**: to build a model to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. | **pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib** <br /> Data preprocessing, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, upsampling, downsampling, auc-roc |
| [Choosing a location for a well (ML)](https://github.com/Nicole0608/Projects_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Well's_Location.ipynb)  | The **goal**: to build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where oil extraction will bring the greatest profit. | **pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib** <br /> Data preprocessing, linear regression, calculation of profit and risks, bootstrap |
| [Gold industry analysis (ML)](https://github.com/Nicole0608/Projects_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Gold_Industry_Analysis.ipynb)  | The **goal**: to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for "X" company. The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from a gold-bearing ore. The essence of the model is to help optimize production so as not to launch a plant with unprofitable characteristics. | **pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib** <br /> Data preprocessing, distribution analysis, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor, linear regression, cross-validation |
